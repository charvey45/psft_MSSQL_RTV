PeopleSoft MSSQL Real Time View.  Capture Blocks, Active SQL, Locks and other MSSQL dynamic view data to assist a PSADMIN

Years of Monitoring PeopleSoft on MSSQL server i've collected as set of Point in time SQL statements that describe what SPIDS/BLOCKS/LOCKS 
are going on at a given instance.  This Project is attempting to automate the execution of these scripts, and to retain a history for
issue post-mortums.
